# User Constrained Thumbnail Generation using Adaptive Convolutions
This repository contains the full source code and instructions to use the code on the dataset described in the paper. We propose to generate thumbnails of user defined sizes with high accuracy and precision without any distortion.

## The code would be uploaded soon
